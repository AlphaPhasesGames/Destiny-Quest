    "napoleonLetter1": "In the early 1800s, American farmers were moving west. They used the Mississippi River to send crops to market through the port of New Orleans. It was super important — without it, they couldn’t sell their food.",
    "napoleonLetter2": "The land west of the river was called Louisiana. It belonged to France, led by Napoleon. He wanted to use the land to help feed his Caribbean colonies. But farmers were worried — if Napoleon closed New Orleans, they were stuck.",
    "napoleonLetter3": "Then, something big happened. In Haiti, formerly enslaved people led by Toussaint L’Ouverture defeated the French. Napoleon no longer needed Louisiana, and with a war against Britain coming, he decided to sell the land instead of risking losing it.",
    "napoleonLetter4": "President Jefferson sent James Monroe to buy New Orleans for $10 million. But Napoleon offered the whole Louisiana Territory for $15 million! That’s double the land for a great price.",
    "napoleonLetter5": "Some Americans didn’t like it — they thought it was too much land or that it broke the rules of the Constitution. But most people were excited. In 1804, Lewis and Clark set off to explore the new land, with help from a Shoshone woman named Sacagawea.",
